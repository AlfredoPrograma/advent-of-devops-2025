# Day 6: Write a Small Terraform Module

## Description
Your team keeps copying and pasting Terraform code for creating S3 buckets. Each bucket needs versioning, encryption, and proper tagging, but the code is duplicated across multiple projects. It's time to create a reusable module.

### Task
- Create a Terraform module for provisioning S3 buckets with best practices built-in.

### Requirements:
- [x] Module accepts customizable inputs
- [x] Enforces security best practices
- [x] Provides useful outputs
- [x] Includes documentation
- [x] Works across multiple environments

### Target
- Reusable module structure
- Variables for customization
- Security features enabled by default
- Clear outputs
